Favorite Linux Command:</br> 
I particularly enjoyed working with Bash scripting, especially using control structures like `if`, `while`, `until`, and `for`. These commands were intuitive and easy to relate to from other programming concepts, which made scripting more enjoyable and logical to understand.</br>

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Linux command-line tools, Bash scripting, and Git version control. I learned how to automate file search and backup operations, manage logs, and structure a clean repository.
